Hands On Neural Network inside Metatrader

In this article, we attempt an approach to the use of architecture and model of deep neural networks INSIDE metatrader 5 plataform "In the box" without external librarys.

Usually quantitave traders download financial timeseries then apply a treatment to the data if necessary (normalization PCA etc...). Finally they train a network(python/R etc..) usually with the objective of reducing the error between the prediction and the real value and finally they take a decision(automatic or not) based on model single prediction value. (This sounds interesting python and r have hundreds of liberties for machine learning some of them interesting as TensorFlow.)

# Mandatory Literature
It is assumed that readers are familiar with the basic concepts of deep networks and financial markets. 

Attached are some truly interesting articles to familiarize the reader with the technology that is intended to be developed.
