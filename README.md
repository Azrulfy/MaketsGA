Hands On Neural Network inside Metatrader

In this article, we attempt an approach to the use of architecture and modeling of deep neural networks INSIDE metatrader 5 plataform "In the box" without external librarys.


# Mandatory Literature
It is assumed that readers are familiar with the basic concepts of deep networks and financial markets. 

Attached are some truly interesting articles to familiarize the reader with the technology that is intended to be developed.

1.-[THIRD GENERATION NEURAL NETWORKS: DEEP NETWORKS](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/1103).

2.-[EVALUATION AND SELECTION OF VARIABLES FOR MACHINE LEARNING MODELS](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/2029).

# About Forex Makets and Metatrader
The Forex market is a decentralized global market of all currencies that are traded around the world. This market is the largest and most liquid in the world, with a daily trading volume in excess of 5 trillion dollars. The other stock markets in the world togethers not come close to this.

Metatrader is a popular software among individual and institutional traders. The main features that make it a reliable and popular software is that most Brokers, Market Makers (ECN) and Banks have acquired its license and offer their clients the possibility to trade with it. It also makes it possible to trade in the markets independently of the Borker without changing the platform.
Of course Metatrader incorporates a tecnical module and object-oriented programming language (in version 5) with you can develop  your own indicators and/or fully automatic trading robots, this makes Metatrader a good choice for both an individual trader and an institutional trader looking for a robust platform.

# About Quantitative Traders
Quantitative trading provides a new science or strategy to operate in the financial markets applying statistical models and in recent years models of maching learning or deep learning.

What are we trying to do with quantitative trading? 

Usually quantitave traders download financial timeseries then apply a treatment to the data if necessary (normalization PCA etc...). Finally they train a network(python/R etc..) usually with the objective of reducing the error between the prediction and the real value and finally they take a decision(automatic or not) based on model single prediction value. (This sounds interesting python and r have hundreds of liberties for machine learning some of them interesting as TensorFlow.)
